                 I will continue to use programming/computer science to continue to learn as a student because this clock showed us new concepts in coding that we never used before, for example we learned new javascript functions and things we had no idea we could ever do. These concepts are very commonly used and we can apply them in many of our projects to come. The aspect that made the most significant
                 impact on me was how in depth these languages are. It's so crazy to think that someone made a language for coding and made all these functions and everything that we use. It's crazy to think about how much work must have gone into it.
